## Running the Code

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip(3) install matplotlib pandas
```

### Max Increase to Keep City Skyline
```bash
# Run the main solution with test cases
python(3) MaxIncreaseSkyline/maxSkylineSol.py

# Run performance analysis and generate charts
python(3) MaxIncreaseSkyline/maxSkylineAnalysis.py
```

### Container With Most Water
```bash
# Run the solution with test cases
python(3) ContainerWithMostWater/Solution.py

# Run complexity analysis and performance comparison
python(3) ContainerWithMostWater/Complexity\ Analysis.py
